# CommodityPricePredictor
## Problem Statement
 In today's global economy, the prices of essential commodities vary significantly across regions and market types (Retail, Wholesale, Producer, Farm Gate). These fluctuations can pose challenges for consumers, businesses, and traders who need to make informed purchasing or selling decisions. Additionally, the dynamic nature of local and global economies makes it difficult to predict future price changes, which impacts supply chain management, consumer budgets, and overall market stability. This project aims to analyze how regional and market type variations influence commodity price trends and to develop a model that predicts future prices based on historical data.
